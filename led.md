# NeoPixels on Iris frame

The following posts try to document the work around the lights on my Iris.  The project was to accomplish a few goals:

1. Learn the Arducopter code base
2. Provide visual feedback via lights
3. Provide orientation lights during flight
4. Work with I2C interface to a Arduino daughter board.
