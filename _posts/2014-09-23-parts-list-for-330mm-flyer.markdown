## Part Choices

The parts lists can be found here: [Parts Manifest](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Q9trwu-_SFND56t_7eJe3O5gw2sjTM1oxGrMA9YYhlI/edit?usp=sharing)

Parts are in for the 330mm flyer based on the DJI F330 knockoff from HobbyKing.  I did notice that the DJI has some nice features like an integrated power distribution in the lower plate which saves the trouble of having to wire a harness or get a distribution board.  The HobbyKing F330 frame has some flex near the motor pads.  I expected the arms to be stiffer but can't speak to whether the DJI frame has the same flex.

I've received most of the parts from:

* HobbyKing (majority)
* Amazon (Misc, like the absortion gel)

I am using a FrSky module which matches with the Radio from 3DR for the Iris; opting in for the telemetry based option.

Parting from the APM code base, I also chose the MultiWii controller to get some exposure to other autopilots.  I did consider KK and a few others, but decided to give this one a try.

## XCalc Values

The parts were plugged into xcalc which came up with these [values](http://www.ecalc.ch/xcoptercalc.php?ecalc&lang=en&cooling=2.5&rotornumber=4&config=1&weight=827&calc=auw&elevation=500&airtemp=25&qnh=1013&batteries=0&battcap=2100&battri=0.0125&battv=3.7&battccont=20&battcmax=50&battweight=63&chargestate=0&s=3&p=1&esc=0&esccont=25&escmax=25&escri=0.015&escweight=30&motor=turnigy&type=35|sk3-2826-1130&gear=1&propeller=0&propconst=1.3&proptwist=0&diameter=8&pitch=4.5&blades=2):
