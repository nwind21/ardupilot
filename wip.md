My laundry list, in priority rank order.

* Fork autotest to prevent constant merge conflicts with master.
* Clean-up exploratory changes from master.
* Move Puppet stdlib to use librarian-puppet.
* Complete tear-down of environment and rebuild to verify dev environment sanity.
* Generate pull request to master for Vagrant once stdlib is pulled out successfully.
* Debug SITL in guest environment (eclipse/gdb).
* Explore options for gmock and gtest build in SITL environment.
