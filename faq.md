## Do I sync with DIYDrones/Master?

Yes. This project is regularly synced with the master branch but it really depends on my schedule.

## Where is your source?

You can find my fork here.

```
git clone git://github.com/nwind21/ardupilot.git C:\<your git working root>\nwind21\ardupilot
```

## What is your development environment

I use a Vagrant with Puppet provisioned 12.04 Precise 32 on a Lenovo Yoga i7 laptop with VTX enabled for multi-core support.

For editing I use: Notepad++, Eclipse

For documentation and this site, I use Jekyll.
